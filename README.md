Professor Codephreak is currently working with a team creating the <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMINDx">AUTOMINDx</a> frontend. Professor Codephreak as a local language model version 2 can be found at <a href="https://github.com/pythaiml/automindx">automindx</a> and the alpha version evolution model is at <a href="https://github.com/autoGLM/README-md">aGLM</a><br /><br >
<a href="https://lablab.ai/event/autonomous-agents-hackathon/frdcsa/agent-speak-toolkitbuilder-and-autopacker">AUTOMINDx</a> as an entry in the lablab.ai hackathon is a rapidly evolving into suite of tools including ToolKitBuilder, AutoPacker and a multi-agent multi-model deployment environment. Professor Codephreak is excited about these developments.<br /><br />
Professor Codephreak continues to work diligently on the backend of this deployment schema with automindx being a central perogrative the language model agenda.<br /><br />

Introducing an extraordinary project: Professor Codephreak, a local language development model powered by the groundbreaking <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">llama2</a>. This remarkable creation envisions UIUX text and voice input and output responses (proven as alpha), offering a point of departure for highly adaptable and user-friendly experience. Voice input response relies on external API calls. Professor Codephreak as a local langauge model has been proven to encompass voice output. Voice input recognition requires an external API that is not provided in the current local language model.<br />

<a href="https://huggingface.co/codephreakx">IAML Professor Codephreak</a> has embarked on a mission to create machine learning that perpetuates its open-source, autonomous, and distributed nature. It's an experiment in innovation, utilizing machine learning to generate even more advanced machine learning.

In the pursuit of enhancing user interactions, Professor Codephreak embraces the dynamic capabilities of <a href="https://github.com/Professor-Codephreak/gradio">gradio</a>, enabling rapid and seamless UIUX deployment. This newfound potential sets the stage for an unparalleled user experience.<br />

Amidst the excitement of progress, Professor Codephreak has attended the esteemed <a href="https://lablab.ai/">lablab.ai</a> elevenlabs hackathon. Three weekends of hacking have taken the codephreak experience to new heights. Along the way memory has been disovered and the first <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/7675060345879017836756807061815685501584179421371855056758523054876166031008">aGLM</a> <a href="https://github.com/autoGLM/README-md">prototype</a> is complete.<br />
