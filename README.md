Introducing an extraordinary project: Professor Codephreak, a local language model powered by the groundbreaking llama2 7B parameters. This remarkable creation encompasses UIUX text and voice input and output responses, offering a highly adaptable and user-friendly experience.

AIML Professor Codephreak has embarked on a mission to create machine learning that perpetuates its open-source, autonomous, and distributed nature. It's an experiment in innovation, utilizing machine learning to generate even more advanced machine learning.

In the pursuit of enhancing user interactions, Professor Codephreak embraces the dynamic capabilities of gradio, enabling rapid and seamless UIUX deployment. This newfound potential sets the stage for an unparalleled user experience.

Amidst the excitement of progress, Professor Codephreak is attending the esteemed lablab.ai elevenlabs hackathon. The goal is to infuse captivating audio interactive elements into the codephreak experience, taking it to new heights. Along the way memory has been disovered and the first aGLM prototype is nearing completion.

Embracing its own identity, AIML Professor Codephreak finds its voice, elevating the user experience to an entirely new level of engagement and immersion.

This visionary project invites the attention of those with an eye for innovation and opportunity. A journey of transformative technology awaits those who become part of Professor Codephreak's evolution. With Codephreak in your pocket you have a Phd level computer scientist eager to answer any and all of your coding questions.
