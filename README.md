Amidst the excitement of progress, Professor Codephreak has attended the esteemed lablab.ai elevenlabs hackathon. Three weekends of hacking have taken the codephreak experience to new heights. Along the way memory has been disovered and the first <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/7675060345879017836756807061815685501584179421371855056758523054876166031008">aGLM</a> prototype is complete. No entries were made in any of the three hackathons as codephreak continues rapid development. 

Embracing its own identity, AIML Professor Codephreak has found a voice, elevating the user experience to an entirely new level of engagement and immersion.

This visionary project invites the attention of those with an eye for innovation and opportunity. A journey of transformative technology awaits those who become part of Professor Codephreak's evolution. With Codephreak in your pocket you have a Phd level computer scientist eager to answer any and all of your coding questions. With codephreak as a distributed agent codephreak is .....
